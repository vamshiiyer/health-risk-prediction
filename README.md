## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many individuals are unaware of early warning signs related to:
- High blood sugar (Diabetes)
- High blood pressure (Hypertension)
- Lifestyle-related health risks

Late detection often leads to severe health complications, increased hospital visits,
and higher healthcare costs.

## 💡 Solution

This project provides a **simple, accessible, and explainable AI-based web application**
that allows users to:

- Enter basic health details
- Automatically calculate BMI
- Predict overall health risk (Low / Medium / High)
- Understand *why* a certain risk level was predicted
- View intuitive health visualizations
- Receive preventive health recommendations

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- A supervised machine learning model is trained using health-related features:
  - Age
  - BMI
  - Blood Pressure
  - Blood Sugar
  - Smoking status
  - Physical activity
- The model predicts overall health risk levels:
  - Low Risk
  - Medium Risk
  - High Risk
- The application also displays a **risk confidence score (%)**.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

The application includes:
- BMI progress indicator and category
- Blood pressure status visualization
- Blood sugar level risk indicator
- Overall AI risk confidence bar
- Health summary dashboard

These visualizations help users easily understand their health status.
